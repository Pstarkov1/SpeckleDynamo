# SpeckleDynamo
### Current status

**!!! WORK IN PROGRESS !!!**



#### What's working

- account selection and connection (via the nodes and via an extension too)

- sender and receiver integration with core

- basic data conversion (created SpeckleDynamoConverter! > basic types, points lines)

- layers (basic implementation)

- dynamic inputs and outputs on sender/receiver

  â€‹

#### What's not working

- data structures other than a single item, so lists and trees need to be flattened and their structure needs to be stored in the layer topology
- any other geometric primitive other than points and lines
- various bugs
- more stuff I don't remember
